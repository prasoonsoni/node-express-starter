To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
### Prerequisites
In order to get a copy of the project you will require you to have Node.js (v14+) and the NPM package manager installed. If you don't have it, you can download the latest version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) which also installs the NPM package manager by default.
### Installation
Open the terminal in the folder in which you wish to clone the repository and enter the following command:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/prasoonsoni/node-express-starter.git
cd node-express-starter
```
Install all the NPM packages:
```
npm i
```
In order to run the server:
```
npm i -D nodemon (One time installation)
npx nodemon
```

> **Note that you will have to add your own `.env` file at the root directory and add your own environment variables for the project to build.**

Following are the environment variables used for backend:
- `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB URI for your database
